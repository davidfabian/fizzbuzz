'''
goal to write a small program. Input is a list of integers( intList), output is a new list with some items replaced.
replace rules: if the item is divisible by 3, replace it with Fizz, if it is divisible by 5, replace it with Buzz,
if it's divisible by both 3 an 5, replace it with FizzBuzz.
return a list.
'''

def fizzbuzz(intList):

    '''
    for every item in the list check if it's divisible by 3. if yes, check if it's divisible by 5 too. otherwise,
    check if it's divisible by 5. This way, all conditions checked. If none applies, copy the corresponding item from
    the original list.
    '''

    outList=[]
    #path to check 3, then 5
    for i in intList:
        if i%3==0:
            outList.append("Fizz")
            if i%5==0:
                outList[-1]="FizzBuzz"
        #path to check 5, but not 3:
        elif i%5==0:
            outList.append("Buzz")
        #if not 5 nr 3:
        else:
            outList.append(i)
    print(outList)

#to test the program
fizzbuzz([10,1,23,54,2,7,88,15,2,3,30,234234,5])
